## üßë‚Äçüíª What I‚Äôm Working On

- **[ANPAC (Automatic Neptune Printing and Clearing)]**: A custom macro system I developed for my Neptune 4 Pro 3D printer to fully automate print bed clearing. It‚Äôs all about increasing efficiency by prepping the printer for the next job without manual intervention.
  
- **[BatchOS]**: A lightweight batch script-based operating system that I created for learing purposes. It was a fun challenge to design and build something simple yet interresting.

I‚Äôm always experimenting and learning, so keep an eye out for more cool projects coming soon!
